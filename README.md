# NeuroSharp
A Visual C# Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm, and Machine Learning library.

## Purpose
This library is being developed as an alternative to the few other CSharp Machine Learning libraries. The focus points of this library will be performance and simple high-level API with Low level exposed API for advanced users.

## Status
**Current Status**: `Early Development`

  <tr><th colspan=2><b>Status Legend</b></th></tr>
  <tr><td>Early Development</td><td>Initial Building of the libary and components. Breaking changes are expected often. <b>Should not be used for production</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Alpha</td><td>Initial construction of types and methods finished, breaking changes less often. Large breaking changes will be announced. <b>Should not be used for production.</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Beta</td><td>All breaking changes will be announced. <b>May be used with production with supervision</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Release</td><td>Deprecated content will have LTS and breaking changes will be phased and announced.</td></tr>
